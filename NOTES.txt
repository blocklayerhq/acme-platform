- bl.Directory:
	- Clearer public API
		- `local` is confusing
		- `from` vs `root` ?
	- If `ref` is exposed, expose the struct to more easily the digest etc

	- It would be very useful to get a reliable `digest` field for every directory.
		--> see acme.infralabs.io/acme.App.api for an example
		--> is this possible? If so, how?
		



- Errors

	- Error messages are often not clear

	- `bl push` does not print error message

	- `bl change info` does not print error message

	- Some errors seem to arrive late

		- Example: `netlify.Account` doesn't exist, but executed Yarn build first


- UX

	- The less I have to remember for my hello world config, the better. Implicit 'package main' would be nice.

	- Would be cool if I could `bl push` a plain cue config file, instead of a while directory, for simple use case. eg.
		```
		echo 'hello: "world"' | bl push --config acme.infralabs.io  -
		```


- bl.BashScript

	- BashScript.output does not create parent directories for me. It would be nice if it did
