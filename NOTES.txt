- bl.Directory:
	- Clearer public API
		- `local` is confusing
		- `from` vs `root` ?
	- If `ref` is exposed, expose the struct to more easily the digest etc

	- It would be very useful to get a reliable `digest` field for every directory.
		--> see acme.infralabs.io/acme.App.api for an example
		--> is this possible? If so, how?
		



- Errors

	- Error messages are often not clear

	- `bl push` does not print error message

	- `bl change info` does not print error message

	- Some errors seem to arrive late

		- Example: `netlify.Account` doesn't exist, but executed Yarn build first
